Geography Subscriptions section of the [real-time updates page](https://instagram.com/developer/realtime/).
When you create a subscription to some geography that you define, you will be returned a unique `geo-id` that
can be used in this query. To backfill photos from the location covered by this geography, use the
[media search endpoint](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/).
